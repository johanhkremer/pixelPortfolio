# Johan's Epic Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Johan's Epic Portfolio! This engaging portfolio not only showcases Johan's burgeoning skills as a frontend developer but also represents the first major milestone in his educational journey from an experienced educator to a dynamic web developer. It’s here that Johan artfully bridges his background in education with his passion for technology, highlighting a diverse skill set that spans from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and responsive design principles.

This will launch the portfolio in your default web browser.
